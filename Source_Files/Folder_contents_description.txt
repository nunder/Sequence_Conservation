F1_TREE_CREATION_SCRIPT

Creates pairwise distance matrix from CRyPTIC variant data downloaded from CRyPTIC FTP site.  The resulting file can then be read into QuickTree to produce Phylip formatted tree.

F2_MUTATION_COUNT_GENERATION

Applies Fitch algorithm to tree to count ancestral mutations for each position in H37Rv reference sequence and output to list (zero_and_non_zero_mutation_counts).

F3_CONSERVATION_PATTERNS_BY_RELATIVE_POSITION

Based on Mycobrowser annotation, for each upstream/downstream region of annotated CDS where minimum intergenic distance is 100nt

F4_ANALYSIS

Calculation of p-values for annotated CDS and related plots.  
Calculation of p-values for maximal ORFs classified by overlap/reading frame relative to annotated ORFs.
Calculation of potential start codons upstream of annotated start codons and compare with those in DeJesus where suggestions are made for a particular ORF.

F5_NOVEL_ORFs

Identify potential mORFs based on orthology (greater than 5 mg with substitution bias
